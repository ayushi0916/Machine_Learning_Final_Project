**Code Structure**

**1. Data Merging**
<br>
In this section, the code handles the merging of data from various sources. It could involve different datasets or sources that need to be combined for analysis.

**2. Data Cleaning**
<br>
This section focuses on cleaning the merged data. It might include tasks like handling missing values, removing duplicates, standardizing formats, and other data preprocessing steps.

**3. Data Splitting**
<br>
Here, the code takes the cleaned data and splits it into training and testing sets. This division is essential for building and evaluating machine learning models effectively.

**4. Model Application**
<br>
This section is dedicated to applying machine learning models to the training data. It involves model selection, training, and parameter tuning.

**5. Model Analysis and Application**
<br>
After training the models, this part of the code likely involves evaluating the models on the test data. This might include metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and more, depending on the problem. Additionally, you might apply the trained models to make predictions on new data.
